# hello-world
My first experience using Github. Following Introductory Tutorial.

So, I'm just going to write a little blurb about myself for the sake of saving changes in Github. I am currently a sophomore at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. In my free time I like to program, play basketball, take free online courses, and play guitar. Follow my Github to stay tuned with my latest programming projects!
